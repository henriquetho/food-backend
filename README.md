## 💻 About

This is an API project for a fictional restaurant. It has the administrator and user. The admin is the person responsible for the restaurant, so he can create, view, edit and delete a dish at any time. Each dish must contain an image, a name, a category, a brief description, the ingredients and their price. By clicking on add dish, the administrator will receive a success message and will be redirected to the main page. The user will view all registered dishes and, when clicking on a dish, will be redirected to a new screen with more information provided about it.
